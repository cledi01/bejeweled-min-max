# bejeweled-recursive-solver

Authors: Caleb Ledi, Kevin Widyatmodjo

Using depth first search to recursively solve bejeweled. Having experimented with various kinds of boards, only a very small subset of boards are actually solvable and be reasonably computed at a given time. The script (python bejeweled.py) will print the winning sequence on the console if there is one, else it will print unsolvable. If there is a winning sequence, it will save all intermediate states of the board being solved as jpgs.

Example:
